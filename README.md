# AH Parser
Simple application that is able to parse incoming packing slip emails from AH to database records.
Together with a simple API and a VueJS front-end the packing slip can easily be viewed as well as each product being able to be marked as delivered.
Helpful as from experience the AH is not always reliable with deliverying everything you have ordered.
